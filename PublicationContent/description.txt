[h1]üìã Description[/h1]
Yet another scoreboard...
Based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963099942]ClassicHUD[/url] and heavily modified.

[h1]‚ùå Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

But I hope that it will be whitelisted - I submitted whitelist request here:

[h1]üéÆ Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator.
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [code]C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config\KFYAS.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][YAS.YAS]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Launch KF2.
[*]Open console (~) and start any map with the mutator (this will generate the default KFYAS.ini content):
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=YAS.Mut[/code]
[*]Close the game and configure the mutator (see [b]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFYAS.ini)[/b] below).
[*]Launch KF2 again, open the console, and start the game:
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Game=KFGameContent.KFGameInfo_Survival?Difficulty=3?GameLength=2?Mutator=YAS.Mut[/code]
(replace the map and set/add parameters you need).
[/olist]

[h1]üñ•Ô∏è Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If this is unclear, first read: [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server Guide (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url][/i]
[olist]
[*]Open [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b].
[*]Find [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and ensure line exists (add if missing):
[code]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/code]
(If there are several [b]DownloadManagers[/b] then the line above should be the first)
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[code]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2521826524[/code]
[*]Start server and wait for mutator download.
[*]When the download is complete, stop the server.
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [code]<kf2-server>\KFGame\Config\KFYAS.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][YAS.YAS]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [code]?Mutator=YAS.Mut[/code] and start the server (this will generate the default KFYAS.ini content).
[*]Stop the server and configure the mutator (see [b]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFYAS.ini)[/b] below).
[*]Start the server.
[/olist]

[h1]üêû (*) Buggy config initialization[/h1]
This mutator (like many others) relies on UnrealScript's default values (0 for int type) to detect first-time use and generate a config.
However, the game contains a bug that initializes unset values to random data, which can lead to incorrect settings or missing configs.

As a workaround, I recommend explicitly setting [b]Version=0[/b] in the config during the first initialization.

Unfortunately, I can't fix this issue because it's a game engine problem (not the mutator's fault).

[h1]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFYAS.ini)[/h1]
[b][YAS.MessageOfTheDay][/b]
Customize messages at the bottom of the panel.
[list][*][b]bRandomize[/b] - If True the message will be chosen randomly.[*][b]DisplayTime[/b] - Message display time in seconds.[*][b]Message[/b] - Array of messages to display. Place multiple 'Message=' below each other if you want to specify multiple messages. If you need a line break in a message, use '[b]\n[/b]'.[/list]

[b][YAS.Ranks][/b]
Display settings for different player ranks.

Edit [b]Player[/b] and [b]Admin[/b] lines to set how this is displayed:
[list][*][b]RankName[/b] - Rank name. Leave blank if you don't want this to be shown.[*][b]RankColor[/b] - Rank color.[*][b]PlayerColor[/b] - Player name color of the player with this rank.[/list]

Use [b]Rank[/b] array to set your own ranks:
[list][*][b]RankName[/b] - Same as above.[*][b]RankColor[/b] - Same as above.[*][b]PlayerColor[/b] - Same as above.[*][b]RankID[/b] - Used to establish a relation between a player and his rank.[*][b]OverrideAdmin[/b] - If True then this rank will be displayed even if the player is an admin.[/list]

[b][YAS.RankRelations][/b]
Use [b]Relation[/b] array to establish a relation between a player and their rank:
[list][*][b]RankID[/b] - RankID from the [b][YAS.Ranks][/b] section.[*][b]ObjectID[/b] - ID for which this rank will be applied. This can be a player's SteamID64, UniqueID, or a steam group's SteamID64 (then the rank will be applied to all members of that group).[/list]

[b]Ranks priority[/b]
[list][*]Personal ranks are higher in priority than group ranks, so if a player belongs to both the group rank and the personal rank, then the personal rank will be used.[*]The higher the position in [b][YAS.RankRelations][/b] the higher the rank priority. That is, if a player belongs to two group relations at once, the one that is higher in the list will be used.[/list]

[b]Rank example[/b]
When your config is generated for the first time there will be an example rank - 'Man of Culture'. It has green color and relation with ObjectID 103582791429670253 (which is the SteamID64 of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/hentaii]this group[/url]). Thus, if you leave this setting, when someone from this group enters the game, he will have a green rank 'Man of Culture'.
You can use this as a template for creating your own ranks, or remove it if you don't need it.

[h1]üîé Getting IDs[/h1]
You can view the Steam ID and UniqueID in WebAdmin on the PLAYERS tab:
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenZmeY/KF2-YetAnotherScoreboard/master/PublicationContent/ID1.png[/img]

But don't try to use the SteamID from here for EGS players - it won't work. SteamID is for Steam players only. UniqueID is suitable for all platforms.

SteamID can also be obtained from the player's profile, look at the URL:
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenZmeY/KF2-YetAnotherScoreboard/master/PublicationContent/ID2.png[/img]

If a player uses a nickname in a link to their profile, then add this to the profile url: [b]?xml=1[/b]
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenZmeY/KF2-YetAnotherScoreboard/master/PublicationContent/ID3.png[/img]

If you need a SteamID64 for a steam group, open the group in a browser and add this to the url: [b]/memberslistxml/?xml=1[/b]

[h1]‚òëÔ∏è Status: Completed[/h1]
‚úîÔ∏è The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
‚õîÔ∏è Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
